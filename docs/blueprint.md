## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) to evoke a sense of calm and trustworthiness, suitable for an educational institution.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) to keep the site bright and airy.
- Accent color: Pale yellow (#F0E68C) to provide a warm and friendly contrast, highlighting important sections without overwhelming the calm color scheme.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern and humanist sans-serif for clear readability across all devices. 
- Use simple, outline-style icons to match the clean and modern look. Icons should be related to school and learning.
- Employ rounded cards for content containers to soften the overall appearance. Use a grid system for responsiveness and a clean arrangement.
- Implement subtle fade-in transitions when loading new content or navigating pages to give smooth feedback to the user.
